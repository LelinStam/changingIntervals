# Individual Project Problem Statement: Swim Training Pal

### Overview

Training individually can be very difficult and de-motivating. The Swim Training Pal was created to bring together a community of swimmers and help track and share workouts. They also help swimmers in the same area meet to train together and stay motivated in reaching their goals. While tracking progress and mileage, the community board allow swimmers to share upcoming events and tips and tricks for training.
